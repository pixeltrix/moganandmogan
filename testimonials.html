      Michael Mogan was in charge of fundraising at Coventry Cathedral
      when I was Sub-Dean. I have also seen him at work in other areas
      including Charities and projects around the Midlands. His approach
      is, regrettably unusually in his profession, one of listening
      carefully to the client and not seeking to fool people with things
      he cannot deliver. My experience of his raising funds in a wide
      range of increasingly unlikely areas was of inventiveness, detailed
      knowledge and exhaustive hard work. I recommend him very strongly.

      Michael worked for me for 10 years as Development Director at
      Coventry Cathedral where I co-founded and chaired the Development
      Trust. The fundraising for the Ministry of the Cathedral was
      enormously enhanced with Michael’s professionalism and his engaging
      personality. During that 10 year period we succeeded in raising
      some £4m and enabled the Cathedral to maintain a good financial position
      allowing the Ministry to continue securely. I greatly enjoyed working
      with Michael and always found his style both very refreshing and highly
      effective. His research of grant giving trusts was exceptionally strong.

      I have worked with Michael on a number of fund raising schemes. The
      common theme is they have always been innovative, successful and
      above all fun projects to work on.

      Over the past 8 years, Michael’s skill in raising funds from a
      variety of different sources has enabled us to develop the delivery
      of our charitable mission and increase our output significantly so
      that now, over 10,000 children each year benefit from our work. He
      has also bonded both office staff and volunteers with his inimitable
      wit, creating a happy and incredibly productive team.

      After spending a number of months learning about the fundraising
      function from Michael, I have gone on to enjoy a successful
      fundraising career of my own, resulting in my appointment to an
      executive post at the University of Warwick.

      Michael played a key role in my training as a professional
      fundraiser and continues to work closely with Blue Tree Fundraising.
      His advice and guidance has helped BTF to flourish and we are
      pleased to be able to maintain our partner relationship.

      I was well aware of the excellent work Michael did for Coventry
      Cathedral at the time of the Millennium, and the huge sums he raised
      for the Millennium Memorial Chapel. More recently he helped me to
      kick-start the raising of funds to restore the historic ‘Handel’
      organ in Holy Trinity Church, Gosport.  Michael is one of the few
      fund raisers, sufficiently confident in his own ability, to charge
      only a percentage of the funds he brings in, instead of a flat fee –
      he is to be commended.

      Tiny Tim’s Children’s Centre recruited Mogan and Mogan in July 2010
      to help us to raise more monies from trusts, companies, individuals
      and charitable events. Michael has bonded well with the team and has
      helped us to secure tens of thousands of pounds of new monies for
      our work with children with disabilities. Our investment in Mogan
      and Mogan has proven to be incredibly worthwhile and positive
      results were achieved remarkably quickly. As the photograph shows,
      Michael has even managed to get me, Centre Manager, to dress as an
      Elf for a successful joint-initiative with a local Lions Club!

      I have known Michael for a number of years and consider him to be
      reliable, trustworthy, full of good ideas and, importantly, able to
      carry them out.

      Michael worked with The Davie Cooper Centre to help us identify
      funding from a range of trusts and organisations. He immediately
      bonded with staff within our project offices and has become a good
      friend of the charity. He displayed great enthusiasm in fundraising
      for our project and provided us with invaluable knowledge regarding
      a successful fundraising strategy. Michael’s expertise and friendly
      approach has proved most beneficial to our cause.

      Many people talk about raising funds but their ability to do it is
      very limited. Michael Mogan actually can and will. I had the honour
      and privilege of working with him for several years when I was the
      director of the International Centre for Reconciliation at Coventry
      Cathedral. During the time I was there our budget rose from about
      just £30,000 a year to nearly £1m raising funds for things as
      diverse as the religious track of the Middle East Peace process to
      the reopening of the Anglican Church in Baghdad. He did it all and
      through him things actually happen. I therefore recommend him
      wholeheartedly without any hesitation.

      Michael joined the fundraising team at the Heart of England NHS
      Charity when it was undergoing a change in strategy and direction.
      With his expertise in raising funds through grant making
      organisations and his willingness to share his fundraising knowledge
      with the wider team, Michael has helped accelerate the progress of
      fundraising beyond the expectation of the Board of Trustees. His
      support to me personally has been invaluable in helping shape the
      future of fundraising and building a sustainable model to fit the
      needs of the organisation.

      We appointed Mogan and Mogan to help us find new donors in 2012.
      Michael discussed our needs and helped us revisit our appeal
      literature. He unearthed a significant number of potential funders
      we had not considered before which was very encouraging. Within
      three weeks of sending out appeals, we had fully recovered the sum
      invested and monies continue to arrive on a weekly basis. He has
      delivered what he set out to do for us and we have been impressed
      with the results.

      Michael put in place a fundraising strategy for my world-first
      polar exploration project. The money I spent on employing
      Michael was returned thirty-fold and he helped me to build a
      team of influential and committed Ambassadors. His determination
      to get results is commendable.

      I have worked with Michael on a couple of occasions in very
      different circumstances. Firstly through his work with Coventry
      Cathedral where his tact and diplomacy made a lasting impression
      on me and a very happy memory for my extended family. In my
      professional arena Michael has worked with us at Coventry School of
      Art and Design in brokering some great relationships and enabled us
      to secure significant funding for technology which is allowing us to
      foster the fashion designers of tomorrow. His expertise in this area
      is exceptional, his enthusiasm is boundless and what surprised us
      most was the speed at which decisions were made and funds were made
      available. We look forward to working with him again.

      We have been very impressed with the services of Mogan and Mogan.
      Diane has been excellent to work with, has listened to our needs
      and planned the trust mailing around our capacity. She has responded
      promptly to all of our questions and is now following up the success
      of the mail out with further applications to specific trusts. We
      were consulted on the content of the appeal letter which we had
      complete ownership of, whilst benefitting from expert advice. The
      money back guarantee gave us the confidence to go ahead, and with a
      return on investment of just over 4:1 to date, we will certainly be
      using the service again. This exceeded our expectations and for our
      organisation, has meant a welcome injection of unrestricted funds.

      We approached Mogan and Mogan to help widen our support from Trusts
      and Foundations. For a small charity like ours, the time needed to
      research new trusts is time we just do not have. With minimal time
      invested by our team, Mogan and Mogan introduced us to new Trusts
      and successfully raised just over £25,000.  The charity will
      continue to build upon these new relationships with aim to increase
      the level of support from these new Trusts over the years.

      We approached Mogan and Mogan in early 2014 as KairosWWT was
      coming to the end of a Big Lottery grant. We liaised with Diane
      extensively over what our charity does and who would be the most
      suitable funding bodies to approach.  We agreed a price that would
      incur no cost to the charity, and Diane then provided us with an
      up-to-date list of carefully researched trusts, plus a
      comprehensive letter for each. Over the next ten months we were
      lucky enough to gain unrestricted funding with a return on
      investment of 12:1 from numerous funders – with amounts ranging
      from £100 to £7,500. This money allowed us to continue to run our
      service whilst we prepared and submitted our latest bid to the Big
      Lottery Community Fund, which was successful in December 2014.
      Therefore, we have no hesitation in recommending the services of
      Mogan and Mogan.

      One of the outstanding appointments that I had the fortune to make
      as Provost of Coventry was in 1996, when we recruited Michael Mogan
      to the position of Development Director of the Coventry Cathedral
      Development Trust. Michael accepted our aim to raise money for the
      Cathedral’s ministry of International Reconciliation, whether it was
      bringing together Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland, or
      enabling former Far East Prisoners of War to meet their captors and
      torturers in Japan and form a deep relationship. Michael never
      hesitated to use his initiative to pursue different avenues of
      raising funds. He also became my right hand man in running the
      ‘Provost’s Breakfasts’ five times a year, bringing together the
      leaders of the City and the County of Warwick, who became
      instrumental in fund-raising. His enthusiasm and integrity shone
      through and enriched, literally, those for whom he worked.

      Michael served the Cathedral and its Development Trust faithfully
      for many years raising hundreds of thousands of pounds. He
      maintained excellent relationships with funders and was a constant
      source of new ideas. He was also loyal and supportive throughout his
      time. I commend him warmly.

      We employed Michael for six days to help research new funders and to
      make targeted approaches on our behalf. The money we spent on
      employing Michael was returned 10-fold.

      A pure chance meeting at a polar exploration event changed my
      perspective and insight on what can be achieved with a fund raiser
      such as Michael Mogan. Within a few minutes discussion it was clear
      how knowledgeable he could be to raise significant funds to support
      medical research. He had me thinking hard of how I positioned my
      research to access funding. He was very free to share his knowledge
      but his real value was his expertise and insight into the practical
      and particular nature on how to approach various organisations to
      support specific research or fund raising needs. I am aware he has
      helped many different causes with success way beyond their
      anticipation, including myself.

      I never realised putting on an art exhibition would be so expensive.
      In late 2010, I had the simple idea of searching out and displaying
      artists’ original design sketches, cartoons and models within
      Coventry Cathedral where they could be viewed alongside the
      corresponding art treasures, famed as icons of mid-twentieth-century
      Christian art. It would be an exhilarating addition to the
      Cathedral’s 2012 Golden Jubilee celebrations. But the execution was
      complex and the cost projections frightening. The feasibility of
      “Journey into the Light”, as it became known, was dependent on very
      quickly raising tens of thousands of pounds. With no experience of
      fundraising, I asked Michael to help. It has been a hard journey,
      full of obstacles, blind alleys and disappointments, but by late
      2011, a mixture of grants, donations and sponsorship brought the
      target into view and we were able to proceed with confidence towards
      the exhibition’s opening the following autumn. Although fundraising
      had been a team effort, it was Michael’s experience and insight that
      gave it direction and his positive attitude and tenacity that kept
      us going when the going got tough. Our target was achieved in full
      by April 2012.

      Since meeting Michael Mogan, when he was Development Director for
      Coventry Cathedral, I have been impressed by his enthusiasm,
      commitment and diligence, to any cause for which he is seeking
      funding.
