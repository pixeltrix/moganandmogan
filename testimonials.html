<h2>What people are saying about us</h2>
<ul id="testimonial-quotes">
<li>
<blockquote><span>Michael worked for me for 10 years as Development Director at Coventry Cathedral where I co-founded and chaired the Development Trust. The fundraising for the Ministry of the Cathedral was enormously enhanced with Michael’s professionalism and his engaging personality. During that 10 year period we succeeded in raising some £4m and enabled the Cathedral to maintain a good financial position allowing the Ministry to continue securely. I greatly enjoyed working with Michael and always found his style both very refreshing and highly effective. His research of grant giving trusts was exceptionally strong.</span></blockquote>

<h3>David Burbidge, DL, OBE</h3>
<p>Former Chairman, <br>Coventry Cathedral Development Trust</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>One of the outstanding appointments that I had the fortune to make as Provost of Coventry was in 1996, when we recruited Michael Mogan to the position of Development Director of the Coventry Cathedral Development Trust. Michael accepted our aim to raise money for the Cathedral’s ministry of International Reconciliation, whether it was bringing together Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland, or enabling former Far East Prisoners of War to meet their captors and torturers in Japan and form a deep relationship. Michael never hesitated to use his initiative to pursue different avenues of raising funds. He also became my right hand man in running the ‘Provost’s Breakfasts’ five times a year, bringing together the leaders of the City and the County of Warwick, who became instrumental in fund-raising. His enthusiasm and integrity shone through and enriched, literally, those for whom he worked.</span></blockquote>

<h3>The Very Reverend John Petty</h3>
<p>Dean Emeritus, Coventry Cathedral</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Since meeting Michael Mogan, when he was Development Director for Coventry Cathedral, I have been impressed by his enthusiasm, commitment and diligence, to any cause for which he is seeking funding.</span></blockquote>
<h3>Alfred Youell, MBE, ONZM</h3>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Michael served the Cathedral and its Development Trust faithfully for many years raising hundreds of thousands of pounds. He maintained excellent relationships with funders and was a constant source of new ideas. He was also loyal and supportive throughout his time. I commend him warmly.</span></blockquote>
<h3>The Very Reverend John Irvine</h3>
<p>Dean, Coventry Cathedral</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>I have worked with Michael on a number of fund raising schemes. The common theme is they have always been innovative, successful and above all fun projects to work on.</span></blockquote>

<h3>Roger Medwell</h3>
<p>CEO, NP Aerospace</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>We employed Michael for six days to help research new funders and to make targeted approaches on our behalf. The money we spent on employing Michael was returned 10-fold.</span></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/photos/dominic-mclean.jpg" width="160" height="208" alt="Dominic McLean"></p>
<h3>Dominic McLean</h3>
<p>Chief Executive, Northampton Volunteer Centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Over the past 8 years, Michael’s skill in raising funds from a variety of different sources has enabled us to develop the delivery of our charitable mission and increase our output significantly so that now, over 10,000 children each year benefit from our work. He has also bonded both office staff and volunteers with his inimitable wit, creating a happy and incredibly productive team.</span></blockquote>
<h3>Christopher Monks, FRCO</h3>
<p>Artistic Director, Armonico Consort</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Michael mentored me in my first fundraising role at GFS Platform for Young Women and has been a reliable source of ideas and support to me during my time in subsequent roles at The Laura Centre and Home-Start UK.  Michael helped design a major local press campaign at a time when The Laura Centre was in a financial crisis, which helped ensure its survival and has identified new funders to approach and critiqued funding proposals, many of which have resulted in grant awards.</span></blockquote>
<h3>Diane Kaczmar</h3>
<p>Home-Start UK</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>After spending a number of months learning about the fundraising function from Michael, I have gone on to enjoy a successful fundraising career of my own, resulting in my appointment to an executive post at the University of Warwick.</span></blockquote>

</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Michael played a key role in my training as a professional fundraiser and continues to work closely with Blue Tree Fundraising. His advice and guidance has helped BTF to flourish and we are pleased to be able to maintain our partner relationship.</span></blockquote>
<h3>Matt Adam</h3>
<p>Founder of Blue Tree Fundraising</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>I was well aware of the excellent work Michael did for Coventry Cathedral at the time of the Millennium, and the huge sums he raised for the Millennium Memorial Chapel. More recently he helped me to kick-start the raising of funds to restore the historic ‘Handel’ organ in Holy Trinity Church, Gosport.<br><br>Michael is one of the few fund raisers, sufficiently confident in his own ability, to charge only a percentage of the funds he brings in, instead of a flat fee – he is to be commended.</span></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/photos/geoffrey-holroyde.jpg" width="160" height="208" alt="Geoffrey Holroyde, ARCO"></p>
<h3>Geoffrey Holroyde, ARCO</h3>
<p>Honorary Fellow of Birmingham Conservatoire</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Tiny Tim’s Children’s Centre recruited Mogan and Mogan in July 2010 to help us to raise more monies from trusts, companies, individuals and charitable events. Michael has bonded well with the team and has helped us to secure tens of thousands of pounds of new monies for our work with children with disabilities. Our investment in Mogan and Mogan has proven to be incredibly worthwhile and positive results were achieved remarkably quickly. As the photograph shows, Michael has even managed to get me, Centre Manager, to dress as an Elf for a successful joint-initiative with a local Lions Club!</span></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/photos/sarah-hemings.jpg" width="160" height="208" alt="Sarah Hemings"></p>
<h3>Sarah Hemings</h3>
<p>Centre Manager, Tiny Tim’s Children’s Centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>I have known Michael for a number of years and consider him to be reliable, trustworthy, full of good ideas and, importantly, able to carry them out.</span></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/photos/jeryl-wheeler-bennett.jpg" width="160" height="208" alt="Sarah Hemings"></p>
<h3>The Hon Mrs Jeryl Wheeler-Bennett</h3>
<p>Deputy Lieutenant, DStJ</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Michael worked with The Davie Cooper Centre to help us identify funding from a range of trusts and organisations. He immediately bonded with staff within our project offices and has become a good friend of the charity. He displayed great enthusiasm in fundraising for our project and provided us with invaluable knowledge regarding a successful fundraising strategy. Michael’s expertise and friendly approach has
proved most beneficial to our cause.</span></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/photos/jackie-mcdonald.jpg" width="158" height="121" alt="Jackie McDonald"></p>
<h3>Jackie McDonald</h3>
<p>Director/Secretary, The Davie Cooper Centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Many people talk about raising funds but their ability to do it is very limited. Michael Mogan actually can and will. I had the honour and privilege of working with him for several years when I was the director of the International Centre for Reconciliation at Coventry Cathedral. During the time I was there our budget rose from about just £30,000 a year to nearly £1m raising funds for things as diverse as the religious track of the Middle East Peace process to the reopening of the Anglican Church in Baghdad. He did it all and through him things actually happen. I therefore recommend him wholeheartedly without any hesitation.</span></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/photos/andrew-white.jpg" width="380" height="208" alt="Canon Andrew White"></p>
<h3>Canon Andrew White</h3>
<p>Vicar of St George's Church Baghdad and <br>Director of the High Council of Religious Leaders in Iraq</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>A pure chance meeting at a polar exploration event changed my perspective and insight on what can be achieved with a fund raiser such as Michael Mogan. Within a few minutes discussion it was clear how knowledgeable he could be to raise significant funds to support medical research. He had me thinking hard of how I positioned my research to access funding. He was very free to share his knowledge but his real value was his expertise and insight into the practical and particular nature on how to approach various organisations to support specific research or fund raising needs. I am aware he has helped many different causes with success way beyond their anticipation, including myself.</span></blockquote>
<h3>Philip McTernan</h3>
<p>Associate Professor/Reader at University of Warwick</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Michael joined the fundraising team at the Heart of England NHS Charity when it was undergoing a change in strategy and direction. With his expertise in raising funds through grant making organisations and his willingness to share his fundraising knowledge with the wider team, Michael has helped accelerate the progress of fundraising beyond the expectation of the Board of Trustees. His support to me personally has been invaluable in helping shape the future of fundraising and building a sustainable model to fit the needs of the organisation.</span></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/photos/emma-hale.jpg" width="160" height="208" alt="Emma Hale"></p>
<h3>Emma Hale</h3>
<p>Head of Fundraising, Heart of England NHS Charity</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Speight of the Art is fast developing into a nationally recognised children’s creative arts charity. In these difficult times, every donation penny counts! The great and generous British public alone is becoming hard pressed to dig deeper into its pockets. Michael Mogan, whom we met only a few months ago, has provided us with an enthusiastic and dynamic approach to our funding needs. His knowledge of those UK Trust sources provided a fitting platform on which to make donation requests. The results have been excellent. Funds began to arrive almost immediately, a fitting tribute to his knowledge. This registered charity, Speight of the Art – the Mark Speight Foundation has no hesitation in recommending his services to you. We are developing a long term relationship on a sound footing with him.
</span></blockquote>
<h3>Oliver Speight</h3>
<p>Speight of the Art – the Mark Speight Foundation</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>We appointed Mogan and Mogan to help us find new donors in 2012. Michael discussed our needs and helped us revisit our appeal literature. He unearthed a significant number of potential funders we had not considered before which was very encouraging. Within three weeks of sending out appeals, we had fully recovered the sum invested and monies continue to arrive on a weekly basis. He has delivered what he set out to do for us and we have been impressed with the results.</span></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/photos/keith-croxton.jpg" width="160" height="208" alt="Keith Croxton OBE, MCIM"></p>
<h3>Keith Croxton OBE, MCIM</h3>
<p>Chair, Community Care North Buckinghamshire</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>I never realised putting on an art exhibition would be so expensive. In late 2010, I had the simple idea of searching out and displaying artists’ original design sketches, cartoons and models within Coventry Cathedral where they could be viewed alongside the corresponding art treasures, famed as icons of mid-twentieth-century Christian art. It would be an exhilarating addition to the Cathedral’s 2012 Golden Jubilee celebrations. But the execution was complex and the cost projections frightening. The feasibility of “Journey into the Light”, as it became known, was dependent on very quickly raising tens of thousands of pounds. With no experience of fundraising, I asked Michael to help. It has been a hard journey, full of obstacles, blind alleys and disappointments, but by late 2011, a mixture of grants, donations and sponsorship brought the target into view and we were able to proceed with confidence towards the exhibition’s opening the following autumn. Although fundraising had been a team effort, it was Michael’s experience and insight that gave it direction and his positive attitude and tenacity that kept us going when the going got tough. Our target was achieved in full by April 2012.
</span></blockquote>
<h3>John Willis</h3>
<p>Lead Curator, Journey into the Light</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Michael put in place a fundraising strategy for my world-first polar exploration project. The money I spent on employing Michael was returned thirty-fold and he helped me to build a team of influential and committed Ambassadors. His determination to get results is commendable.</span></blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/photos/mark-wood.jpg" width="380" height="208" alt="Mark Wood"></p>
<h3>Mark Wood</h3>
<p>World-first achieving polar explorer</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>Michael Mogan was in charge of fundraising at Coventry Cathedral when I was Sub-Dean. I have also seen him at work in other areas including Charities and projects around the Midlands.  His approach is, regrettably unusually in his profession, one of listening carefully to the client and not seeking to fool people with things he cannot deliver. My experience of his raising funds in a wide range of increasingly unlikely areas was of inventiveness, detailed knowledge and exhaustive hard work. I recommend him very strongly.</span></blockquote>
<h3>The Right Reverend Justin Welby</h3>
<p>Bishop of Durham</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><span>I have worked with Michael on a couple of occasions in very different circumstances. Firstly through his work with Coventry Cathedral where his tact and diplomacy made a lasting impression on me and a very happy memory for my extended family. <br><br>In my professional arena Michael has worked with us at Coventry School of Art and Design in brokering some great relationships and enabled us to secure significant funding for technology which is allowing us to foster the fashion designers of tomorrow. His expertise in this area is exceptional, his enthusiasm is boundless and what surprised us most was the speed at which decisions were made and funds were made available. We look forward to working with him again.</span></blockquote>
